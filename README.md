Air pollution is a serious global issue. This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using environmental pollutant data like CO, NO₂, O₃, PM2.5 along with geographic information. The solution is built in a clean and reproducible **Jupyter Notebook** using **Random Forest Regressor**.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- ✅ Predicts AQI using machine learning
- 🌐 Uses geo-tagged pollution data from multiple countries
- 📊 Visualizes correlation between pollutants and AQI
- 🔍 Compares feature importance for pollutants
- 🚀 Deploy-ready structure with requirements
